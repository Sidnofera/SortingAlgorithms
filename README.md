# Sorting Algorithms Implementation in C++

## Project Description
This project implements various sorting algorithms in C++ to demonstrate proficiency in algorithm design, data structures, and problem-solving skills. Each sorting algorithm is implemented and tested on sample arrays to showcase its functionality and efficiency.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
1. **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
2. **Selection Sort**: Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
4. **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.
5. **Quick Sort**: Picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.
6. **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
